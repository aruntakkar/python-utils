printscreen-win

This is a simple util to automate the Print Screen process on Windows.

Place the printscreen-win.lnk and printscreen-win.py to c:\utils.

The c:\utils can be changed but you need to edit the shortcut file.

The shortcut file expects that your python is located here:
c:\Python27\pythonw.exe

Copy the shortcut to your Desktop and make a "Shortcut Key" from its Properties.
Default one that I use is Ctrl + Alt + S

Once you execute the script it will save a new screen shot under:
...\Desktop\screen\

The util needs Python 2.x and PIL:

Enjoy!
