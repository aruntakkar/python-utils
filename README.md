printscreen-win

This is a simple util to automate the Print Screen process on Windows.

Copy the both files to 
c:\utils\printscreen-win.lnk
c:\utils\printscreen-win.py

The c:\utils can be changed but you need to edit the link file.

The link file expects that your python is:
c:\Python27\pythonw.exe

Copy the link to your Desktop and make a "Shortcut Key" from its Properties.
Default one that I use is Ctrl + Alt + S

Once you execute the script it will save a new screen-shot under 
...\Desktop\screen\

The util needs Python 2.x and PIL:

Enjoy!
